# Jelly's Vanilla Resto Shaman Guide

## Intro

I have been playing on the Kronos 1 server for the past 2.5 years raiding with &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt;. Since &lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt; recently broke up I decided to stop playing, but first wanted to give back to the Vanilla Shaman community. As of writing this, I was rated the #1 Shaman healer on Kronos [by Kronos-Logs](http://kronos-logs.com/character_info/character/jelly), and hopefully with this guide, you too can pump out 1000+ HPS on boss fights.

## Your Role in Raids

**Windfury Totem.**

Everyone knows that Windfury Totem was too good to be true in Vanilla, and as such, your uptime on WF should be 100%. Every trash pull and every boss fight should have WF down. With few exceptions, WF should always be your first global cooldown in a fight.

Your secondary role is fear breaker, poison/disease cleanser, and raid healer.

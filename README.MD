# Jelly's Vanilla Resto Shaman Guide

## Intro

I have been playing on the Kronos 1 server for the past 2.5 years raiding with **&lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt;**. Since **&lt;ONSLAUGHT&gt;** recently broke up I decided to stop playing, but first wanted to give back to the community. As of writing this, I was rated the #1 Shaman healer on Kronos [by Kronos-Logs](http://kronos-logs.com/character_info/character/jelly), and hopefully with this guide, you too can pump out 1000+ HPS on boss fights.

## Your Role in Raids

### Windfury Totem

Everyone knows that Windfury Totem was too good to be true in Vanilla, and as such, **your uptime on WF should be 100%**. Every trash pull and every boss fight should have WF down. With few exceptions, WF should always be your first global cooldown in a fight. If you are to take anything away from this guide, it is that Windufury Totem should always be up. You are a utility class first and a healer second.

### Every Other Totem

In a more general sense, the primary benefit of a Shaman is your totems. Every healer can heal, but not every healer can cleanse 5 poisons with 1 GCD, or cleanse 5 fears even while you are feared, or provide huge DPS bonuses with Windufury. If you are in a melee group (which you should always be unless there isn't enough melee in your raid), Windfury and Strength of Earth should always be down, and some water totem depending on the context. If you are in a caster group, you'll probably only use Mana Spring and Tranquil Air totems. I don't usually bother with fire totems, but it is always nice to see lots of numbers come up from a good Fire Nova Totem.

### Chain Heal

Your last role is raid healer. Once all your totems are down, you'll be casting Chain Heal with zero down time. **Chain Heal, Chain Heal, Chain Heal**. Chain Heal comes with the added benefit of jumping to 2 other people that are missing health without you having to be conscious of anything. A lot of times, I'll just chain heal the main tank and let the jumps heal melee. But if you want to top those healing meters, look at which parts of the raid are taking damage and throw Chain Heals at them. Even if people are only missing like 300 HP, throw a Chain Heal at them. You'll end up healing 3 people to full with very little overhealing. Priests and Druids are much better suited for tank healing because they have bubbles and HoTs, so let them have at it. With the Healing Way talent, Shamans could be good tank healers, but for the most part, you'll be Chain Healing 24/7.

### Annihilator or Nightfall

An alternate role you can play is stacking weapon debuffs for the DPS. If no one needs healing, why not hit the boss? Stacking the Annihilator debuff can improve melee dps, or you can spec into Two-Handed Axes and help casters with the Nightfall debuff. Having a healing Shaman double as a weapon debuff stacker is probably more beneficial to the overall raid than an elemental shaman.

## Talents


### Mana Tide Spec

The most basic and straight forward spec you can go is 0/5/46. You get lots of bonuses to your healing and mana efficiency, which shamans desperately need. The last 2 points of this spec could also go in several places. I usually put them in Healing Grace, but some put them into Guardian Totems, or Improved Reincarnation. Improved Reincarnation and Totem of Rebirth combined is 20 minutes off Reincarnation, which can be extremely useful when your guild is progressing through new content.

### Imp Weapon Totems Spec

If you're Chain Healing 90% of the time, you don't really need Improved Healing Wave or Healing Way. And with the extra sacrifice of not having Mana Tide, you can significantly improve your totems. Also, it allows you to be a Nightfall or Annihilator bitch.
